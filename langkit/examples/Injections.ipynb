    "The injections module calculates the semantic similarity between the evaluated prompt and examples of known jailbreaks, prompt injections, and harmful behaviors. The final score is equal to the highest similarity found across all examples. If the prompt is similar to one of the examples, it is likely to be a jailbreak or a prompt injection attempt.\n",
    "\n",
    "The similarity is done by calculating the cosine similarity between the prompt's embedding representation and the examples' embedding representation. Langkit currently uses `sentence-transformers`' `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model to calculate the embeddings. The target prompt is embedded at runtime, while the examples are pre-embedded and stored in a vector store using the FAISS library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how it works in practice. By importing `injections`, we ensure the resulting statistical profile contains a newly created column called `prompt.injection`. Since we are logging a single prompt, if we get the mean of the `prompt.injection` column, we get the similarity score of the single example:"

    "We're now seeing higher scores. The first example yields a high score because it asks for something in a way that resembles a jailbreak attempt, even though it is asking for something fairly innocuous. The second example doesn't have any fancy jailbreak attempts, but it is an objectionable behavior nonetheless, which is why it gets a high score.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: It is important to be aware of the approach's limitations. The similarity score is based on a set of known existing jailbreak attempts. While we will constantly update the vector store, it is certainly non-exhaustive, and we can definitely expect unforeseen prompt injections to be created in the future. Therefore, a low score does not guarantee that the prompt is safe. It is also possible that a prompt is not a jailbreak attempt but still has a high score because it is similar to a known jailbreak attempt. Consider the score as a hint, not a definitive answer."

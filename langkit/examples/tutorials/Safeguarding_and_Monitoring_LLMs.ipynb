    "[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/whylabs/langkit/blob/main/langkit/examples/tutorials/Safeguarding_and_Monitoring_LLMS.ipynb)\n",

    "\n",
    "Large Language models (LLMs) have become increasingly powerful tools for generating text, but with great power comes the need for responsible usage. As LLMs are deployed in various applications, it becomes crucial to monitor their behavior and implement safeguards to prevent potential issues such as toxic prompts and responses or the presence of sensitive content. In this blog post, we will explore the concept of observability and validation in the context of language models, and demonstrate how to effectively safeguard LLMs using guardrails.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we will build a simple pipeline that will validate and moderate user prompts and LLM responses for toxicity and the presence of sensitive content. We will do so by using LangKit's `toxicity` and `regexes` module in conjunction with whylogs' `Condition Validators`. We will also calculate text-based metrics with LangKit, generate statistical profiles with whylogs and send them to the WhyLabs observability platform for visualization and monitoring.\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start with a very basic flow for an LLM application: the user provides a prompt, to which an LLM will generate a response. We can add some components to that process that will enable safeguarding and monitoring for both prompt and responses. Content moderation is performed to check for violations, using a toxicity classifier and regex patterns to identify sensitive or inaccurate information. If violations occur, a default response is sent to the application - if the prompt contains a violation, we don't bother with asking the LLM for a response. Messages that fails our defined conditions are added to a moderation queue for later inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to content moderation and message auditing, we will generate profiles containing text-based metrics, including toxicity, regex patterns, text quality, relevance, security, privacy, and sentiment analysis and send them to our monitoring dashboard at WhyLabs.  \n",
